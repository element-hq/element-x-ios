### Update the bundle identifier / app display name

To change the bundle identifier and the app display name for your app, open the `project.yml` file in the project root folder and change these settings:

```
BASE_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER: io.element.elementx
APP_DISPLAY_NAME: Element X
```

After the changes run `xcodegen` to propagate them.

### Setup the location sharing

The location sharing feature on Element X is currently integrated with [MapLibre](https://maplibre.org).

The MapLibre SDK requires an API key to work, so you need to get one for yourself. 

After you get an API key, you need to configure the project by adding it inside the file `secrets.xconfig` in the project root folder. After you are done, the file should contain a setting like this:

```
MAPLIBRE_API_KEY = your_map_libre_key
```

Itâ€™s not recommended to push your API key in your repository since other people may get it. 

One way to avoid pushing the API key by mistake is running on your machine the command: 
```
git update-index assume-unchanged secrets.xcconfig
``` 
this will prevent pushing any update of the file`secrets.xcconfig`.
