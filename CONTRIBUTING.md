## Setting up a development environment

### Xcode

We suggest using an Xcode version later than 13.2.1.

The Xcode project can be directly compiled after checkout through the shared ElementX scheme which includes the main application as well as the unit and UI tests.

The Xcode project itself is generated through [xcodegen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) so any changes shouldn't be made directly to it but to the configuration files.

### Dependencies

Dependencies will be automatically fetched through the Swift Package Manager, including a release version of the MatrixRustSDK. If you encounter issues while resolving the package graph please attempt a cache reset through `File -> Packages -> Reset Package Caches`.

For instructions on how to setup the RustSDK in development mode please refer to the [matrix-rust-components-swift](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-components-swift) repository.

### Continuous Integration

ElementX uses Fastlane for running actions on the CI and tries to keep the configuration confined to either [fastlane](fastlane/Fastfile) or [xcodegen](project.yml). 

Please run `bundle exec fastlane` to see available options.

## Pull requests

Please see our [pull request guide](https://github.com/vector-im/element-android/blob/develop/docs/pull_request.md).

## Implementing a new screen

New screen flows are currently using MVVM-Coordinator pattern. Please refer to the screen template under [Tools/Scripts/createSimpleScreen.sh](Tools/Scripts/createSimpleScreen.sh) to create a new screen or a new screen flow.

## Coding style

For Swift coding style we use [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) to check some conventions at compile time (rules are located in the `.swiftlint.yml` file). 
Otherwise please have a look to [Apple Swift conventions](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines.html#conventions). We are also using some of the conventions of [raywenderlich.com Swift style guide](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-style-guide).

We enforce the coding style by running checks on the CI for every PR through [Danger](Dangerfile.swift), [SwiftLint](.swiftlint.yml) and [SonarCloud](https://sonarcloud.io/project/overview?id=vector-im_element-x-ios)

We also gather coverage reports on every PR through [Codecov](https://app.codecov.io/gh/vector-im/element-x-ios) and will eventually start enforcing minimums.
