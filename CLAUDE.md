# Project Context — Element X iOS Branded Fork

## Skill Override — IMPORTANT

**This is an iOS/Swift/SwiftUI project. IGNORE all Flutter/Dart global skills.**

The following global skills are NOT applicable to this project and must be completely disregarded:
- Flutter skills (tdd-workflow, unit-testing, widget-testing, bloc-testing, bloc-architecture, clean-architecture, repository-pattern, error-handling, mocking-patterns, feature-structure, dependency-injection, and all other Flutter-specific skills)
- Flutter agents (flutter-senior-engineer)
- Flutter commands (flutter-test, flutter-lint, generate-bloc, generate-feature, generate-model, build-runner)
- All Flutter architecture patterns (BLoC, Riverpod, GetIt, Freezed, Dart-specific patterns)

**Project-specific local skills (in `.claude/skills/`):**

## What This Is

A branded fork of **Element X iOS** (open-source Matrix messenger, SwiftUI) to be published on Apple App Store under a customer's brand. The project is: rebrand + reconfigure + publish. No new features.

**Developer:** Saidakhror Murzaliev (solo, 20h/week, AI-assisted with Claude Code)
**Customer:** Russian-speaking, has existing Matrix infrastructure

## Current Phase

**Phase 1: Project Setup — partially complete.** Fork created, build environment configured, first build succeeded, codebase audit complete, git branching structure established.

**What's done:**
- Fork created and pushed to `smurzaliev/custom-element-messenger-ios`
- Build environment: Xcode 26.2, XcodeGen 2.44.1, git-lfs, `gh` CLI v2.86.0
- First build succeeded on iPhone 17 Pro simulator (Xcode 26.2)
- Full codebase audit (5 parallel agents): identity, branding, config, localization, strings
- Change map compiled → `documentation/change_map.md`
- Git structure: `main` (releases) + `develop` (active, default) + `upstream` (element-hq)
- Tag `checkpoint/unmodified-build` at commit `7c96ebfca` (last upstream commit before fork changes)
- Claude Code slash commands for git workflows in `.claude/commands/`

**What's blocked (all require customer decisions):**
- Step 5: Bundle identity changes (needs App Name, Bundle ID, Team ID — D-001)
- Steps 6–14: Branding, config, OIDC, push, calls, testing, App Store
- See `decisions_tracker.md` for all 12 tracked decisions (D-001 through D-012)

**Next action:** Conduct initial meeting with customer using `customer_questionnaire_init_stage.md`, then send `customer_pre_dev_briefing_ru.md`. Resolve blockers before proceeding to Step 5.

### Blockers (must be resolved before rebranding work starts)

1. **AGPL v3 licensing** — Element X is AGPL v3, which conflicts with App Store ToS. Commercial license from Element (New Vector Ltd) required. NOT YET INITIATED.
2. **APNs vs FCM** — TOR says FCM, project uses APNs natively. Customer must confirm APNs. NOT YET DECIDED.
3. **iOS version** — TOR says iOS 16+, project requires iOS 18.5+ (develop branch). Customer must accept. NOT YET DECIDED.
4. **Calls infrastructure** — TOR says Jitsi, project uses Element Call (LiveKit). Customer must clarify. NOT YET DECIDED.
5. **App identity** — App name, bundle ID, team ID, app group needed before any code changes. NOT YET DECIDED (D-001).

> See `decisions_tracker.md` for all 12 tracked decisions with statuses (D-001 through D-012).

|------|------------|
| **`ios_proj_init.md`** | **START HERE when development begins.** 15-step technical plan from fork to first branded build. Covers architecture justification, build env, branding, localization, config, OIDC, push, calls. Includes Claude-specific task delegation and audit commands. |
| `implementation_plan.md` | Day-by-day schedule: 30 working days + 10 buffer (English) |
| `implementation_plan_ru.md` | Same schedule in Russian |

### Customer-Facing Documents

| File | Purpose |

## Source Project Facts

| Fact | Value |
|------|-------|
| Repository | `github.com/element-hq/element-x-ios` |
| Language | Swift 100%, SwiftUI |
| Architecture | Coordinator-based MVVM |
| Build system | XcodeGen (`project.yml`, `app.yml`, `target.yml`) + SPM |
| Core SDK | Matrix Rust SDK (Swift bindings via SPM, **opaque — cannot modify**) |
| Design system | Compound (Element's cross-platform semantic design tokens) |
| LOC | ~68,000 across ~907 Swift files |
| License | AGPL v3 (**legally problematic for App Store**) |
| iOS minimum | 18.5 (develop branch, forked from) |
| Push | APNs directly (no Firebase SDK) |
| Calls | Element Call (MatrixRTC + LiveKit, not Jitsi) |
| Auth | OIDC (redirect URI hardcoded to element.io — must change) |

## Key Files to Modify (When Development Starts)

```
app.yml                          → Bundle ID, display name, team ID, app group
AppSettings.swift                → Homeserver URL, OIDC, push gateway, pusher ID, analytics, legal URLs, feature flags
target.yml / entitlements        → Associated domains, push, app group
Assets.xcassets                  → App icon, accent color, launch screen
InfoPlist.strings (37+ locales)  → CFBundleDisplayName
Compound design tokens           → Accent color, theme
OIDC configuration               → Client ID, redirect URI
NSE/SupportingFiles/target.yml   → NSE bundle ID, entitlements
```

## Key Technical Discrepancies (TOR vs Reality)

| TOR Says | Reality | Impact |
|----------|---------|--------|
| FCM (Firebase) | APNs directly, no Firebase SDK | Use APNs — saves 10–16h |
| Jitsi | Element Call (MatrixRTC + LiveKit) | Customer needs LiveKit, not Jitsi |
| iOS 16+ | iOS 17+ minimum | Customer must accept |
| Scalar integration manager | Not in Element X | Not applicable |
| OIDC not mentioned | OIDC hardcoded to element.io | Must reconfigure |

## Estimates

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Effort (without AI) | 85–132h, expected ~120h |
| Effort (with Claude Code) | ~60–95h, expected ~80h |
| Calendar time | 6–8 weeks at 20h/week (best case 4–5 weeks if all blockers pre-resolved) |
| Rate | $17/hr |
| Fixed price | $2,000–$2,200 |

## Working Rules

### General

- **No new features.** This is strictly rebrand + reconfigure. Do not add functionality beyond what Element X already has.
- **Do not modify Matrix Rust SDK** — it's an opaque binary dependency.
- **Never edit `.xcodeproj` directly** — it's generated by XcodeGen. Edit YAML files, then run `xcodegen generate`.
- **Pin SDK versions** at fork time. Do not upgrade unless necessary.
- **Keep the fork minimal** — every change increases future merge difficulty with upstream.

### Languages

- Documents for the customer → **Russian**
- Technical docs, code, commit messages → **English**

### Decisions & Tracking

- Track all decisions in `decisions_tracker.md`. Update status after every customer interaction.
- Use licensing checkpoints at Days 5, 11, 20, 27 (see `implementation_plan.md`).

### File Naming

- Project documents → `snake_case.md`
- Code files → Follow Element X existing conventions (don't rename upstream files)

### Git

- Branching: `main` (releases, at `checkpoint/unmodified-build`) + `develop` (active work, default on GitHub) + `upstream` remote (tracks element-hq/element-x-ios)
- Tag `checkpoint/unmodified-build` at `7c96ebfca` — last upstream commit before any fork changes
- 10 named checkpoints during init phase (see `ios_proj_init.md` Step 15)
- Commit format: Match existing upstream style (imperative, concise)
- Slash commands available: `/git-commit`, `/git-push`, `/commit-push-pr`

### Claude-Specific

- **Before modifying any file:** Read it first.
- **After bulk changes:** Run audit commands from `ios_proj_init.md` Section 18.3.
- **When stuck on signing/provisioning:** Ask the developer — these require Xcode GUI or Apple Portal.
- **When a decision from `decisions_tracker.md` is unresolved:** Do not guess. Flag it and ask.

## Customer Context

- Customer is Russian-speaking
- Customer has existing Matrix infrastructure (homeserver, Sygnal, possibly OIDC)
- Customer's TOR was written assuming older Element iOS patterns (FCM, Jitsi, iOS 16)
- Customer expects 4–6 week delivery (realistic: 6 weeks if all goes well, 8 with buffer)
- Customer needs to be educated on: AGPL licensing, APNs vs FCM difference, Element Call vs Jitsi (see `customer_pre_dev_briefing_ru.md`)
